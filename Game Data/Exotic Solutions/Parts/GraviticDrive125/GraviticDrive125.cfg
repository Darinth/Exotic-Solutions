	description = By manipulating gravitational effects, this 1.25m gravitic drive pushes against it's SOI. Gravitic drives aren't able to produce lateral movement and their thrust is directly proportional to the gravitational effects they experience. Much more powerful under strong gravity, much weaker under weak gravity.
